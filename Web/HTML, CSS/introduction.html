                    <strong><h1>Who am I?</h1></strong>
                    <p>My full name is Tran Duy Thanh. I also have another name is Youth22341. I was born in 2001 and I'm studying mechatronics at Bach Khoa University of Technology Ho Chi Minh City. I have passionate about mathematics, automation and coding (but bad at electronics T=T). Besides that I love working with team mate and help others with my knowledge. In FE field, I don't have so much experience. I only know HTML, CSS basic through TEK4.VN.
                    About my character, maybe I will be quiet at first sight, but don't worry, it do not take long. To know more, I have 2 chanels to connect, welcome you to come and see:<br>

                    <strong><h1>Who I met today?</h1></strong>
                    <p>As usually, I surf Tiktok to relax after studying so hard. In that social, I use to like watching news about tech, music, Kpop,..Suddenly I see the news about teaching JavaScript in next month, which only 2 slots left. I'm so excited because it's the thing I'm looking for now. 
                    With no hesitation, I left the comment to the creator to let they know that I noticed. Not for long after that, the creator send me a message and introduce himself that he is a senior developer FE. He open the class with 3-4 students and be a mentor in 3 months to teach them about all knowledge to work in FE field: JavaScript, React, real projects,..
                    He also warn that the field of knowledge is so large then he can sure with 90% confidence that we will have job after.</p>

                    <strong><h1>What did we discuss about?</h1></strong>
                    <p>Well, honestly I really like this class. But I'm also feel so concerned because in the next January I have to turn back to my final thesis. I don't know if I can have time to learn in this class? That's why I told him if he had a plan already, I would like to watch it then I can say I'm suitable or not.
                    I have been waiting for him about 20 minutes but there is no reply. Then I wrote something about my current status, that FE is not my main majority but mechatronics is. I feel sad because maybe I can not go along with him now. In that time I will study more about Web then I can know more when I'm in his class.
                    So surprised that he came back with sorry, because he was teaching FE11 class then he didn't notice my message in Tiktok. He also let me know that he used to learn mechatronics and working wrongly majority. </p>

                    <strong><h1>Does it important to me now?</h1></strong>
                    <p>Why not? I think now I find a right mentor for me. I uesd to worry that how can I continue to learn this knowledge enough to get job after graduating? I won't let this opoturnity be missed, I asked him if I can contact with him through Zalo? He sent me his phone and I have inbox already, just waiting for him now!
                    I'm very excited now. I wrote these words to let he knows more about me.</p>
